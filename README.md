# Final-Project-2024
CO2 Production Data (1970s to 2010): The project applies various regression techniques to predict CO2 production per capita for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 based on historical data.  Temperature Data (Annual Temperature for Two Industries).
# Regression Analysis on CO2 Production and Temperature Data

This repository contains code and results for regression analysis on two datasets:

1. **CO2 Production Data (1970s to 2010)**:
   - Predict CO2 production per capita for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 based on historical data.

2. **Temperature Data (Annual Temperature for Two Industries)**:
   - Predict future temperatures for the years 2016 and 2017 based on historical temperature data from two different industries.

## Project Overview

This project applies various regression techniques to analyze and predict data trends. It includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Application of different regression models
- Evaluation of model performance

## Data

### Dataset 1: CO2 Production Data
- **Source**: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pICQq6Qa77zFfga68RK93ACqYtvajin4)
- **Description**: Historical data of CO2 production per capita from the 1970s to 2010.

### Dataset 2: Temperature Data
- **Source**: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nPXI8skf0n5uiZnpJ1eKjQQSj7pKm-FG)
- **Description**: Annual temperature data for two industries.

## Models

The following regression models are applied and evaluated:

- **Linear Regression**: A basic model for predicting the target variable.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy through multiple decision trees.
- **Decision Tree Regression**: A model that makes predictions based on decision rules.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A model that uses support vector machines for regression tasks.

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **RÂ² Score**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent values
